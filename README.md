### Hi ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to this repository
### 
####This is a sample project that serves only one simple purpose:
####-> Getting me started with Jenkins
	
####My Jenkins Server itself runs inside of a docker container on a virtual private server. - https://162.55.187.56/ (no money for domains). My login credentials are pretty **unsecure**. I would appreaciate if you wouldn't try to brute force your way in.

####All traffic to it is being encrypted using TLS via a self-signed certificate using an NGINX proxy.

####Thats really all there is to it. If you are looking for a cloud resource provider to also run a useless Jenkins server on, why don't you give https://www.hetzner.com/cloud a shot.
