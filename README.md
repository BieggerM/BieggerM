### Hi ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m currently working on a small Project called icanhazpw (maybe you know the meme). I wanted to get into Go Development so i chose to create a small webservice. Take a look at it if you are interested. ðŸŽ‰
- In my learning process i try to draw inspiration from the [brilliant roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops) by [Kamran Ahmed](https://github.com/kamranahmedse) ðŸ“–
- Since KubeCon / CloudnativeCon, I consider myself an advocate for GitOps culture

Best Regards
